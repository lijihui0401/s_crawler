The last approach is typically limited to controlling the dihedral angle around the interring single bonds to prevent loss of π-conjugation. Here we propose a different approach to conformational engineering that involves controlling the twist of the aromatic units comprising the backbone by using a tether of varying lengths. We demonstrate this approach by synthesizing an inherently twisted building unit comprised of helically locked tethered acenes, bearing acetylene end-groups to enable backbone extension, which was applied in a series of nine helical oligomers with varying backbone length and twist. We find that the optical and electronic properties of π-conjugated systems may be determined by the additive, antagonistic, or independent effects of backbone length and twist angle. The twisted oligomers display chiral amplification, arising from the formation of secondary helical structures.","Organic chemistry, Physical chemistry",2022-01-21,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-022-28072-7,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-022-28072-7.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Controlling the helicity of π-conjugated oligomers by tuning the aromatic backbone twist.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 17:02:45","2025-07-11 17:02:45"

Maintaining charge separation is a major challenge but is key to unlocking this potential. Here we discovered a metal–organic framework (MOF) that shows suppressed charge recombination. This MOF features electronically insulated Zn2+ nodes and two chemically equivalent, yet crystallographically independent, linkers. These linkers behave as an electron donor–acceptor pair with non-overlapping band edges. Upon photoexcitation, the MOF undergoes a dynamic excited-state structural twist, inducing orbital rearrangements that forbid radiative relaxation and thereby promote a long-lived charge-separated state. As a result, the MOF achieves visible-light photocatalytic overall water splitting, in the presence of co-catalysts, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 3.09 ± 0.32% at 365 nm and shows little activity loss in 100 h of consecutive runs. Furthermore, the dynamic excited-state structural twist is also successfully extended to other photocatalysts. This strategy for suppressing charge recombination will be applicable to diverse photochemical processes beyond overall water splitting.","Heterogeneous catalysis, Metal–organic frameworks, Organic–inorganic nanostructures, Photocatalysis",2024-08-12,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41557-024-01599-6,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41557-024-01599-6.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Dynamic structural twist in metal–organic frameworks enhances solar overall water splitting.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 17:18:06","2025-07-11 17:18:06"

Stacking atomically thin layers with a small azimuthal misorientation to produce moiré superlattices enables the controlled engineering of electronic band structures and the formation of extremely flat electronic bands. Here, we report a strong twist-angle dependence of heterogeneous charge transfer kinetics at twisted bilayer graphene electrodes with the greatest enhancement observed near the ‘magic angle’ (~1.1°). This effect is driven by the angle-dependent tuning of moiré-derived flat bands that modulate electron transfer processes with the solution-phase redox couple. Combined experimental and computational analysis reveals that the variation in electrochemical activity with moiré angle is controlled by a structural relaxation of the moiré superlattice at twist angles of <2°, and ‘topological defect’ AA stacking regions, where flat bands are localized, produce a large anomalous local electrochemical enhancement that cannot be accounted for by the elevated local density of states alone.","Computational chemistry, Electrochemistry, Electron transfer, Graphene, Two-dimensional materials",2022-02-17,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41557-021-00865-1,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41557-021-00865-1.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Tunable angle-dependent electrochemistry at twisted bilayer graphene with moiré flat bands.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 17:18:06","2025-07-11 17:18:06"

Shepherd","Nature Computational Science","Computationally efficient and accurate quantum mechanical approximations to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation are crucial for computational materials science. Methods such as coupled cluster theory show potential for widespread adoption if computational cost bottlenecks can be removed. For example, extremely dense k-point grids are required to model long-range electronic correlation effects, particularly for metals. Although these grids can be made more effective by averaging calculations over an offset (or twist angle), the resultant cost in time for coupled cluster theory is prohibitive. We show here that a single special twist angle can be found using the transition structure factor, which provides the same benefit as twist averaging with one or two orders of magnitude reduction in computational time. We demonstrate that this not only works for metal systems but also is applicable to a broader range of materials, including insulators and semiconductors.","Computational methods, Density functional theory, Method development, Quantum chemistry",2021-12-16,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s43588-021-00165-1,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s43588-021-00165-1.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/A shortcut to the thermodynamic limit for quantum many-body calculations of metals.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 17:32:47","2025-07-11 17:32:47"

Based on this correlation, a model for accurately predicting thermal conductivity of GBs is constructed using machine learning techniques. The model reveals that small distortions to local atomic environments are sufficient to reduce overall thermal conductivity dramatically.

Furthermore, although its triplet state contains a weaker alkene bond than the singlet, in the quintet state its bond order increases substantially, yielding a flatter structure.

Although structural morphology is found significant for robotic functions, geometric topology has rarely been considered and appreciated. Here we demonstrate a series of knotbots, namely hydrogel-based robots with knotted structures, capable of autonomous rolling and spinning/rotating motions. With symmetry broken by external stimuli and restored by self-regulation, the coupling between self-constraint-induced prestress and photothermal strain animates the knotbots continuously. Experiments and simulations reveal that nonequilibrium processes are regulated dynamically and cooperatively by self-constraints, active deformations, and self-shadowing effect of the photo-responsive gel. The active motions enable the knotbots to execute tasks including gear rotation and rod climbing.

The loosely-twisted isomers smoothly invert between (P)- and (M)-helicity at a rate of 3.31 s–1, while the helicity inversion of the tightly-twisted isomers is undetectable but rather relaxes to the loosely-twisted isomers. This critical difference between these two isomers is explained by the presence or absence of an absolute configuration inversion of the nitrogen atoms of the macrocyclic amine ligand.

Mechanism insight reveals that a subtle balance of crystallization of PDLA and microphase separation between PS and PDLA chains dominates the formation of Moebius strips. An intriguing helix-helix transition occurs during the chiral transfer from microphase to assemblies, which is driven by relaxation of the internal stress within SLM related to orientated stretching of PS chains.

Developing covalent organic frameworks with both high porosity and excellent charge transport properties is crucial for widespread applications, including sensing, catalysis, and organic electronics. However, achieving the combination of both features remains challenging due to the lack of overarching structure-property correlations. Here, we report a strategy toward covalent organic frameworks with tunable dimensionality. The concept relies on splicing one-dimensional charge-conducting channels to form extended networks with tailorable substitution patterns. Such dimensional evolution and substitution control enable fine-tuning of electronic band structure, charge mobility, and porosity. According to surface-area characterization, high-frequency terahertz photoconductivity measurements, and theoretical calculations, the transition from one-dimensional to para-linked two-dimensional networks furnishes a substantial increase in surface area and a decrease in local charge mobility. The latter feature is assigned to substitution-induced electronic band flattening. A subtle balance of surface area (947 m2·g−1) and local charge mobility (49 ± 10 cm2·V−1·s−1) is achieved through the rational design of meta-linked analogs with mixed one-dimensional and two-dimensional superior nature.

This self-regulation occurs robustly in thermodynamic equilibrium rather than kinetic trapping, and therefore is attractive yet elusive. Until now, studies of self-regulating assemblies have focused on non-responsive systems, whose equilibrium point and corresponding size and shape are hardly changeable. Here, we demonstrate a stimuli-responsive, self-regulating assembly. This assembly consists of chiral and magnetically orientable nanorods, where the effective chirality can be changed by balancing chirality-induced twisting and magnet-induced flattening between nanorods.

We noted that increasing the steric bulk around the periphery of π-extended tropylium rings leads them to deviate from planarity to form contorted conformations in which aromatic stabilization and strain are close in energy. Under increasing strain, the aromatic π-electron delocalization of the system is broken, leading to the formation of a non-aromatic, bicyclic analogue referred to as ‘Dewar tropylium’. The aromatic and non-aromatic isomers have been found to exist in rapid equilibrium with one another.

Torsional stress can modulate specific binding of transcription factors to DNA and introduce local conformational changes that facilitate the opening of promoters and nucleosome remodelling. Using all-atom microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations together with a torsional restraint that controls the total twist of a DNA fragment, we address the impact of torsional stress on DNA complexation with a human BZIP transcription factor, MafB. We gradually over- and underwind DNA alone and in complex with MafB by 0.5° per dinucleotide step, starting from the relaxed state to a maximum of 5° per dinucleotide step, monitoring the evolution of the protein-DNA contacts at different degrees of torsional strain. Our computations show that MafB changes the DNA sequence-specific response to torsional stress. The dinucleotide steps that are susceptible to absorbing most of the torsional stress become more torsionally rigid, as they are involved in protein-DNA contacts. Also, the protein undergoes substantial conformational changes to follow the stress-induced DNA deformation, but mostly maintains the specific contacts with DNA. This results in a significant asymmetric increase of free energy of DNA twisting transitions, relative to free DNA, where overtwisting is more energetically unfavourable. Our data suggest that specifically bound BZIP factors could act as torsional stress insulators, modulating the propagation of torsional stress along the chromatin fibre, which might promote cooperative binding of collaborative DNA-binding factors.","Biophysical chemistry, Computational chemistry, DNA, DNA-binding proteins, Molecular dynamics, Molecular modelling",2020-11-02,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-020-75711-4,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-020-75711-4.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Specifically bound BZIP transcription factors modulate DNA supercoiling transitions.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

In soft materials such as amphiphilic lipids and liquid crystals, the competition between local chiral interactions and global constraints imposed by the geometry of the self-assembled structures leads to frustration and the assembly of unique materials3,4,5,6. An example of particular interest is smectic liquid crystals, where the two-dimensional layered geometry cannot support twist and chirality is consequently expelled to the edges in a manner analogous to the expulsion of a magnetic field from superconductors7,8,9,10. Here we demonstrate a consequence of this geometric frustration that leads to a new design principle for the assembly of chiral molecules. Using a model system of colloidal membranes11, we show that molecular chirality can control the interfacial tension, an important property of multi-component mixtures. This suggests an analogy between chiral twist, which is expelled to the edges of two-dimensional membranes, and amphiphilic surfactants, which are expelled to oil–water interfaces12. As with surfactants, chiral control of interfacial tension drives the formation of many polymorphic assemblages such as twisted ribbons with linear and circular topologies, starfish membranes, and double and triple helices. Tuning molecular chirality in situ allows dynamical control of line tension, which powers polymorphic transitions between various chiral structures. These findings outline a general strategy for the assembly of reconfigurable chiral materials that can easily be moved, stretched, attached to one another and transformed between multiple conformational states, thus allowing precise assembly and nanosculpting of highly dynamical and designable materials with complex topologies.","Applied physics, Self-assembly, Soft materials, Stereochemistry",2012-01-04,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature10769,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature10769.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Reconfigurable self-assembly through chiral control of interfacial tension.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Percolation phase transition, on the other hand, only monitors the degree of connection among particles without strict geometric requirements such as translational or orientational order, and thus suitable for pinpointing phase transitions of complex fluids. As typical complex fluids, ionic liquids (ILs) exhibit phases beyond the description of simple liquid theories. In particular, with an intermediate cationic side-chain length, ILs can form the nanoscale segregated liquid (NSL) state, which will eventually transform into the ionic liquid crystal (ILC) structure when the side chains are adequately long. However, the microscopic mechanism of this transformation is still unclear. In this work, by means of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we show that, with increasing cationic side-chain length, some local pieces of non-polar domains are gradually formed by side chains aligned in parallel inside the NSL phase, before an abrupt percolation phase transition happens when the system transforms into the ILC phase. This work not only identifies that the NSL to ILC phase transition is a critical phenomenon, but also demonstrates the importance of percolation theory to complex fluids.","Chemical physics, Liquid crystals",2019-09-11,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-019-49493-3,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-019-49493-3.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Percolation Phase Transition from Ionic Liquids to Ionic Liquid Crystals.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

In contrast the number of synthetic receptors with the capability for enantioselective molecular recognition of chiral substrates is scarce and for chiral cyclophanes indicative for a preferential binding of homochiral guests. Here we introduce a cyclophane composed of two homochiral core-twisted perylene bisimide (PBI) units connected by p-xylylene spacers and demonstrate its preference for the complexation of [5]helicene of opposite helicity compared to the PBI units of the host. The pronounced enantio-differentiation of this molecular receptor for heterochiral guests can be utilized for the enrichment of the P-PBI-M-helicene-P-PBI epimeric bimolecular complex. Our experimental results are supported by DFT calculations, which reveal that the sterically demanding bay substituents attached to the PBI chromophores disturb the helical shape match of the perylene core and homochiral substrates and thereby enforce the formation of syndiotactic host-guest complex structures. Hence, the most efficient substrate binding is observed for those aromatic guests, e. g. perylene, [4]helicene, phenanthrene and biphenyl, that can easily adapt in non-planar axially chiral conformations due to their inherent conformational flexibility. In all cases the induced chirality for the guest is opposed to those of the embedding PBI units, leading to heterochiral host-guest structures.","Coordination chemistry, Molecular capsules, Stereochemistry",2023-01-16,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-023-35851-3,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-023-35851-3.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Preferential molecular recognition of heterochiral guests within a cyclophane receptor.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Phytochromes form a major family of photoreceptors responsible for red light perception in plants, fungi and bacteria1. They undergo reversible photoconversion between red-absorbing (Pr) and far-red-absorbing (Pfr) states, thereby ultimately converting a light signal into a distinct biological signal that mediates subsequent cellular responses2. Several structures of microbial phytochromes have been determined in their dark-adapted Pr or Pfr states3,4,5,6,7. However, the structural nature of initial photochemical events has not been characterized by crystallography. Here we report the crystal structures of three intermediates in the photoreaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP). We used cryotrapping crystallography to capture intermediates, and followed structural changes by scanning the temperature at which the photoreaction proceeded. Light-induced conformational changes in PaBphP originate in ring D of the biliverdin (BV) chromophore, and E-to-Z isomerization about the C15 = C16 double bond between rings C and D is the initial photochemical event. As the chromophore relaxes, the twist of the C15 methine bridge about its two dihedral angles is reversed. Structural changes extend further to rings B and A, and to the surrounding protein regions. These data indicate that absorption of a photon by the Pfr state of PaBphP converts a light signal into a structural signal via twisting and untwisting of the methine bridges in the linear tetrapyrrole within the confined protein cavity.","Light responses, Photobiology, Structural biology",2011-10-16,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature10506,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature10506.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Temperature-scan cryocrystallography reveals reaction intermediates in bacteriophytochrome.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Commercially available phosphines, selected by computational screening, react with the easily accessible salt [Ga(PhF)2-3]+[Al(ORF)4]− (PhF = C6H5F; RF = C(CF3)3) to form ambiphilic gallene cations in situ.

As an example, the reactivity of the in situ formed gallene [Ga(dipf)]+ (dipf = 1,1-bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene) was studied. The cation reversibly dimerizes to the respective digallene in solution. Carbon–carbon multiple bonds in acyclic alkynes and alkenes undergo [2π + 2π] cycloadditions with the digallene [{Ga(dipf)}2]2+.

The crystal, which exhibits a thermal single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase transition which is reversible upon heating and cooling, transforms to the identical phase upon light irradiation at temperatures lower than the thermal transition temperature. The photo-triggered phase transition originates from the strain of trans-keto molecules produced by enol–keto photoisomerization owing to the small energy barrier associated with changes in the crystal structure.

Long plate-like crystals with thickness gradient in the longitudinal direction walk slowly, like an inchworm, by repeated bending and straightening under heating and cooling cycles near the transition temperature. Furthermore, thinner, longer plate-like crystals with width gradient roll much faster by tilted bending and then flipping under only one process of heating or cooling. The length of the crystal is shortened above the transition temperature, which induces bending due to the temperature gradient to the thickness direction.

Here, dipolar rotors have been embedded in a crystalline metal–organic framework. The material consists of Zn(II) nodes and two types of ditopic bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-based linkers—one that coordinates to the Zn clusters through two 1,4-aza moieties, and a difluoro-functionalized derivative (the dipolar rotor) that coordinates through linked 1,4-dicarboxylate groups instead. Upon cooling, these linkers collectively order as a result of correlated dipole–dipole interactions. Variable-temperature, frequency-dependent dielectric measurements revealed a transition temperature Tc = 100 K, when a rapidly rotating, dipole-disordered, paraelectric phase transformed into an ordered, antiferroelectric one in which the dipole moments of the rotating linkers largely cancelled each other. Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional rotary lattice showed a ground state with an Ising symmetry and the effects of dipole–lattice and dipole–dipole interactions.","Metal–organic frameworks, Molecular machines and motors",2021-02-15,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41557-020-00618-6,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41557-020-00618-6.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Dipolar order in an amphidynamic crystalline metal–organic framework through reorienting linkers.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

The twisted and polar Cu(II)–dye conjunction endows the coordination polymer with diode-like photoelectronic behaviours, which hampers the inter- and intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer from the triphenylamine-moiety to the Cu(II) site and permits reversed-directional ground-state electronic conductivity, rectifying the productive loop circuit for synergising photoredox and copper catalysis in pharmaceutically valuable decarboxylative C(sp3)–heteroatom couplings.

In principle, photoswitches with desired photophysical properties like high isomerization quantum yields can be identified through virtual screening with reactive simulations. In practice, these simulations are rarely used for screening, since they require hundreds of trajectories and expensive quantum chemical methods to account for non-adiabatic excited state effects. Here we introduce a diabatic artificial neural network (DANN), based on diabatic states, to accelerate such simulations for azobenzene derivatives.

This work reports on the first study of the nanosecond-pulsed LIDT’s dependence on incident polarization for several optical devices employing oriented nematic and chiral-nematic LC’s oriented by surface alignment layers. Accelerated lifetime testing was also performed to characterize the ability of these devices to maintain their functional performance under multipulse irradiation as a function of the laser fluence at both 1053 nm and 351 nm. Results show that the LIDT varies as a function of input polarization by 30–80% within the same device, while the multipulse LIFT (which can differ from the nominal LIDT) depends on irradiation conditions such as laser fluence and wavelength.","Materials chemistry, Materials for optics, Optical materials and structures, Organic chemistry, Photochemistry",2022-06-29,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-022-14974-5,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-022-14974-5.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Multiparameter laser performance characterization of liquid crystals for polarization control devices in the nanosecond regime.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

How they self-organize themselves is a physical common phenomenon for broad ranges of thermodynamic systems. In this work, the equilibrium phase diagrams of charged chiral rods (fd viruses) at low ionic strengths (below a few mM) are provided to demonstrate both replicas of (or self-organized) twist orders and replica symmetry breaking near high concentration glass-states. By varying the ionic strengths, it appears that a critical ionic strength is obtained below 1–2 mM salt, where the twist and freezing of nematic domains diverge. Also, the microscopic relaxation is revealed by the ionic strength-dependent effective Debye screening length. At a fixed low ionic strength, the local orientations of twist are shown by two different length scales of optical pitch, in the chiral-nematic N* phase and the helical domains \(H_{D}\), for low and high concentration, respectively. RSB occurs in several cases of crossing phase boundary lines in the equilibrium phase diagram of DNA-rod concentration and ionic strength, including long-time kinetic arrests in the presence of twist orders.

However, it is difficult to realize sensitive and reversible covalent bond cleavage/formation through external stimuli in the aggregated state of molecules. Herein, a series of 2,3-diphenylmaleonitriles (DPMNs) with photoinduced π-bond cleavage properties have been designed and synthesized to construct the dynamic covalent bond materials. The cis-form 2,3-diphenylmaleonitriles (Z-DPMNs) exhibit significant photochromism in both solid and solution states under ultraviolet light and visible light. The photochromism stems from the photoinduced π-bond splitting of Z-DPMNs, resulting in a transition from the closed-shell to open-shell structure. Moreover, the twisted structure and molecular stacking of Z-DPMNs, the push-pull electron effect of substituents, and the external factors including temperature and solvent polarity have important effects on the dynamic conversion of π-bonds. Based on the sensitive and reversible optical performance transformation, Z-DPMNs can be applied as safety ink in anti-counterfeiting, information encryption and storage systems. This work not only provides an approach for constructing dynamic covalent bonds but also greatly enriches stimulus-responsive materials.","Information storage, Optical materials, Organic molecules in materials science",2024-08-02,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-024-50943-4,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-024-50943-4.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Photoinduced π-Bond breakage causing dynamic closing-opening shell transition of Z-type Diphenylmaleonitriles molecules.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

In particular, the shape morphing behavior is programmable by controlling the oriented state of the polymer chain in the thermo-responsive network. Whether the shape morphing direction is positive (bending) or negative (flattening) cannot be predicted when the polymerization methods are not informed, revealing a hidden manner. Through deciphering the coupling of chain elastic stresses and thermo-induced deswelling stress, the hydrogel can perform designed and diversified 4D morphing which represents evolution of 3D geometries with time as the fourth dimension. Consequently, the corresponding optical information can be gated based on these geometric features, thereby decrypting the correct permutation of information.

Without racemization, homochiral Poly (lactide acid) can generate two vortex-shaped dendritic crystals with opposite spiral chirality, and snowflake-shaped dendritic crystals without spiral chirality. The transition from homochiral molecules to achiral crystals signifies the chiral symmetry restoration during the ordering process. The primary elements responsible for the various hierarchical transfers of homochiral Poly (lactide acid) are related to chain tilt, surface stress, and frustrated structures of Poly (lactide acid) crystals.

An important example is internal conversion of the anionic green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore where non-selective progress along two competing torsional modes (P: phenolate and I: imidazolinone) impairs and enables Z-to-E photoisomerization, respectively. Developing strategies to promote photoisomerization could drive new areas of applications of GFP-like proteins. Motivated by the charge-transfer dichotomy of the torsional modes, we explore chemical substitution on the P-ring of the chromophore as a way to control excited-state pathways and improve photoisomerization. As demonstrated by methoxylation, selective P-twisting appears difficult to achieve because the electron-donating potential effects of the substituents are counteracted by inertial effects that directly retard the motion. Conversely, these effects act in concert to promote I-twisting when introducing electron-withdrawing groups. Specifically, 2,3,5-trifluorination leads to both pathway selectivity and a more direct approach to the I-twisted intersection which, in turn, doubles the photoisomerization quantum yield.

Here, we apply a combined computational and experimental framework integrating extensive molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational biosensors to investigate the conformational landscape of the angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor) — a prototypical class A GPCR—activation. Our findings suggest a synergistic transition mechanism for AT1 receptor activation. A key intermediate state is identified in the activation pathway, which possesses a cryptic binding site within the intracellular region of the receptor. Mutation of this cryptic site prevents activation of the downstream G protein signaling and β-arrestin-mediated pathways by the endogenous AngII octapeptide agonist, suggesting an allosteric regulatory mechanism. Together, these findings provide a deeper understanding of AT1 receptor activation at an atomic level and suggest avenues for the design of allosteric AT1 receptor modulators with a broad range of applications in GPCR biology, biophysics, and medicinal chemistry.","Communicating chemistry, Protein function predictions",2021-08-05,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-021-25020-9,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-021-25020-9.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Activation pathway of a G protein-coupled receptor uncovers conformational intermediates as targets for allosteric drug design.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Herein we reported SCL impart greater chiral bias to trigger asymmetric photo-polymerization reaction from initially achiral diacetylene (DA) monomer, and the enhanced optical dissymmetry for whole polydiacetylene (PDA) films could be achieved.

X-ray crystal structures illustrate how picometre-scale differences in radius between lanthanum(III) and dysprosium(III) are propagated to Hans-LanM’s quaternary structure through a carboxylate shift that rearranges a second-sphere hydrogen-bonding network. Comparison to the prototypal LanM from Methylorubrum extorquens reveals distinct metal coordination strategies, rationalizing Hans-LanM’s greater selectivity within the rare-earth elements. Finally, structure-guided mutagenesis of a key residue at the Hans-LanM dimer interface modulates dimerization in solution and enables single-stage, column-based separation of a neodymium(III)/dysprosium(III) mixture to >98% individual element purities. This work showcases the natural diversity of selective lanthanide recognition motifs, and it reveals rare-earth-sensitive dimerization as a biological principle by which to tune the performance of biomolecule-based separation processes.","Biomaterials – proteins, Metalloproteins, Supramolecular chemistry, Sustainability, X-ray crystallography",2023-05-31,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41586-023-05945-5,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41586-023-05945-5.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Enhanced rare-earth separation with a metal-sensitive lanmodulin dimer.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

A preliminary sensory evaluation of the treated fibers revealed an evident, though qualitative, improvement of the fiber softness. The effects of the softening agents on the fiber was evaluated quantitatively, by means of macroscopic measurements of the wettability, viscoelasticity, and thermal (thermal gravimetry) properties. Moreover, the effects of the softening treatments on the microscopic structure of the fiber and on its properties at a molecular level, were studied by optical and scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The macroscopic analysis showed that the softeners used increases the hydrophilicity and water wettability of the cellulose fiber with respect to the raw one. Moreover, the dynamical mechanical analysis on sample yarns showed that the softeners increase the interfiber frictional forces. A linear correlation between the interfiber friction and the increase of hydrophilicity and fiber wettability was shown. The treated fiber exhibits a more homogeneous thermal behaviour, due to more homogeneous structural features, since the thermal-induced cellulose fibrils depolimerization undergoes a marked temperature range contraction. These data can be well related with those obtained by microscopy analysis, showing that the fiber surface, after the treatment, appears thinner and less rough, as well as with the XRD analysis, which shows that softeners induce a significant decrease of the fiber crystallinity.","Materials chemistry, Physical chemistry",2021-01-08,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-020-79568-5,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-020-79568-5.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Chemical–physical and dynamical–mechanical characterization on Spartium junceum L. cellulosic fiber treated with softener agents_ a preliminary investigation.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Peptoids, which are relatively non-toxic and resistant to degradation3, can fold into defined structures through a combination of sequence-dependent interactions3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the range of possible structures that are accessible to peptoids and other biological mimetics is unknown, and our ability to design protein-like architectures from these polymer classes is limited9. Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations, together with scattering and microscopy data, to determine the atomic-resolution structure of the recently discovered peptoid nanosheet, an ordered supramolecular assembly that extends macroscopically in only two dimensions. Our simulations show that nanosheets are structurally and dynamically heterogeneous, can be formed only from peptoids of certain lengths, and are potentially porous to water and ions. Moreover, their formation is enabled by the peptoids’ adoption of a secondary structure that is not seen in the natural world. This structure, a zigzag pattern that we call a Σ(‘sigma’)-strand, results from the ability of adjacent backbone monomers to adopt opposed rotational states, thereby allowing the backbone to remain linear and untwisted. Linear backbones tiled in a brick-like way form an extended two-dimensional nanostructure, the Σ-sheet. The binary rotational-state motif of the Σ-strand is not seen in regular protein structures, which are usually built from one type of rotational state.

In water, cellulose nanocrystals form a liquid crystalline phase whose hierarchical structure is retained in solid films after drying. Although tactoids, one of the most primitive components of liquid crystals, are thought to have a significant role in the evolution of this phase, they have evaded structural study of their internal organization. Here we report the capture of cellulose nanocrystal tactoids in a polymer matrix. This method allows us to visualize, for the first time, the arrangement of cellulose nanocrystals within individual tactoids by electron microscopy. Furthermore, we can follow the structural evolution of the liquid crystalline phase from tactoids to iridescent-layered films. Our insights into the early nucleation events of cellulose nanocrystals give important information about the growth of cholesteric liquid crystalline phases, especially for cellulose nanocrystals, and are crucial for preparing photonics-quality films.","Nanoscale materials, Physical chemistry, Structure of solids and liquids",2016-05-04,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/ncomms11515,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/ncomms11515.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Structure and transformation of tactoids in cellulose nanocrystal suspensions.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

This pocket-capturing phenomenon commonly applies to dyes designed under the twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) principle and, therefore, represents a generic but previously unidentified backdoor problem. Accordingly, we create a new A group that avoids being trapped into the albumin pockets (pocket-escaping) and thereby construct a NIR probe, BNLBN, which effectively prevents this backdoor problem with increased imaging accuracy for liver fibrosis in vivo.

Here we systematically evaluated of the structural features driving exo selectivity in thermal normal-electron-demand Diels–Alder reactions. Substitution at the Cβ position and the size and electronegativity of the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile are contributing factors. Experimental and computational studies both point toward the steric and electrostatic forces between the substituents in both the diene and the dienophile that increase the likelihood of the exo pathway. For these substrates, the dominance of the endo pathway is reduced by transition state distortions and poor structural alignments of the reacting partners. We also noted the tilt of the dienophile with respect to the diene causing steric strain on the functionalities at the more advanced bond forming carbon-carbon position of the endo transition state.

On removal of the central sodium—through addition of a cryptand [2.2.1] in solution—the double helicate extends. Crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that the extended helicate is over twice as long as the initial molecule, and is twisted in the right-handed direction.

This motile behavior stems from dynamic transmission of chirality, from the artificial molecular motors to the liquid crystal in confinement and eventually to the helical trajectory, in analogy with the chirality-operated motion and reorientation of swimming cells and unicellular organisms.","Soft materials, Supramolecular chemistry",2019-11-20,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-019-13201-6,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-019-13201-6.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Reorientation behavior in the helical motility of light-responsive spiral droplets.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Here we report the isolation and characterization of the novel 4π-electron tetrasilacyclobutadiene, an analogue of a 4π neutral cyclobutadiene that exhibits surprising features of a Möbius-type aromatic ring. Reduction of RSiCl3 (R = (iPr)2PC6H4) with KC8 in the presence of cycloalkyl amino-carbene (cAAC) led to the formation of corresponding silylene 1. Compound 1 shows further reactivity when treated with RSiCl3 under reducing conditions resulting in the formation of unsymmetrical bis-silylene 2, which was isolated as a dark red crystalline solid. Compound 3 was obtained when chlorosilylene was reduced with potassium graphite in the presence of 2. Although 3 is, according to Hückel’s rule an antiaromatic system it possesses significant aromatic character due to the unusual delocalization of the HOMO-1 and the loss of degeneracy of the higher-lying π MOs. The aromatic character of 3 is indicated by the structural stability of the compound by the very similar Si-Si bond lengths and by the NICS values. There is an unusual π conjugation between the 4 π electrons in the nearly square-planar Si4 ring where the delocalization of the HOMO-1 occurs at two opposite sides of the ring. The reversal of the π conjugation resembles the twisting of the π conjugation in Möbius aromatic systems and it contributes to the stability of the compound.","Chemical bonding, Optical spectroscopy",2024-12-28,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s42004-024-01396-9,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s42004-024-01396-9.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Neutral 4π-electron tetrasilacyclobutadiene contains unusual features of a Möbius-type aromatic ring.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

In this study we used hundreds of quantum–classical trajectories to show that, 15 fs after light absorption, a degeneracy between the reactive excited state and a neighbouring state causes the splitting of the rhodopsin population into subpopulations. These subpopulations propagate with different velocities and lead to distinct contributions to the quantum efficiency. We also show here that such splitting is modulated by protein electrostatics, thus linking amino acid sequence variations to quantum efficiency modulation.

Shape memory polymers are one of the most widely used stimuli-responsive materials, especially in 3D/4D printing, for fabricating shape-morphing systems. They typically go through a hot-programming step to obtain the shape-morphing capability, which possesses limited freedom of reconfigurability. Cold-programming, which directly deforms the structure into a temporary shape without increasing the temperature, is simple and more versatile but has stringent requirements on material properties. Here, we introduce grayscale digital light processing (g-DLP) based 3D printing as a simple and effective platform for fabricating shape-morphing structures with cold-programming capabilities. With the multimaterial-like printing capability of g-DLP, we develop heterogeneous hinge modules that can be cold-programmed by simply stretching at room temperature.

So far, their structural design was primarily driven by challenges related to metamaterials whose practical applications are remote. Here we demonstrate that gold nanorods assembled by the polymerase chain reaction into DNA-bridged chiral systems have promising analytical applications. The chiroplasmonic activity of side-by-side assembled patterns is attributed to a 7–9 degree twist between the nanorod axes. This results in a strong polarization rotation that matches theoretical expectations. The amplitude of the bisignate ‘wave’ in the circular dichroism spectra of side-by-side assemblies demonstrates excellent linearity with the amount of target DNA. The limit of detection for DNA using side-by-side assemblies is as low as 3.7 aM. This chiroplasmonic method may be particularly useful for biological analytes larger than 2–5 nm which are difficult to detect by methods based on plasmon coupling and ‘hot spots’. Circular polarization increases for inter-nanorod gaps between 2 and 20 nm when plasmonic coupling rapidly decreases. Reaching the attomolar limit of detection for simple and reliable bioanalysis of oligonucleotides may have a crucial role in DNA biomarker detection for early diagnostics of different diseases, forensics and environmental monitoring.","Analytical chemistry, Nanophotonics and plasmonics, Nanoscale materials",2013-10-28,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/ncomms3689,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/ncomms3689.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Attomolar DNA detection with chiral nanorod assemblies.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Microscopic, spectroscopic and diffraction analyses of the bent crystal showed that the preservation of crystal integrity when stress is applied on the (001) face requires sliding of layers by breaking and re-formation of halogen–halogen interactions.

To develop high-performance chiral organic semiconducting molecules, a distorted π-system is required for strong coupling with circularly polarized light (CPL), whereas planar π-stacking systems are necessary for high charge-carrier mobility. To address this dilemma, in this work, we introduce a skeleton merging approach through distortion of a perylene diimide (PDI) core with four fused heteroaromatics to form an ortho-π-extended PDI double-[7]heterohelicene. PDI double helicene inherits a high dissymmetry factor from the helicene skeleton, and the extended π-planar system concurrently maintains a high level of charge transport properties.

Here we explore the mechanism of this reaction with density functional theory. Our calculations show that the reaction takes place through a metal (Ag+, Cu+) catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition pathway and the migration of a silylium ion [triisopropylsilyl ion (TIPS+)] further controls the reconstruction of four-member ring to give the final product. The lower barrier of this silylium ion mediated [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism (SMC) indicates that well-controlled [2+2] cycloaddition can obtain some poorly-accessible IEDDA (inverse-electron demand Diels-Alder reaction) products. Strong interaction of d10 metals (Ag+, Cu+) and alkenes activates the high acidity silylium ion (TIPS+) in situ. This п-acid (Ag+, Cu+) and hard acid (TIPS+) exchange scheme will be instructive in silylium ion chemistry.

However, the impact of these interactions on M-ion migration—whether they assist or hinder it—remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the diffusion barriers of M-ions in SE frameworks, focusing on the M2B12H12 family (M = Li, Na, K), and clarify the role of non-covalent interactions. Our computational analyses reveal that moving from Li to Na to K analogues in M2B12H12 results in significant changes in many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions. The MBD interactions act as springs embedded within the M2B12H12 framework, regulating the effective coordination number (ECN) of M-ions and shaping the potential energy landscape for their migration. A linear correlation is observed between ECN and Edisp, consistent across different alkali ions. This correlation reveals a unified mechanism in which dispersion interactions regulate M-ion migration barrier and identifies a critical bottleneck for beyond-Li diffusion in M2B12H12 SEs.

Central to this challenge is the direct experimental evidence of directionality because analytical methods able to follow very fast motions rarely deliver precise geometrical insights. Here, a general photochemical method for elucidation of directional motions is presented. In a macrocyclization approach the molecular motor rotations are restricted and forced to proceed in two separate ~180° rotation-photoequilibria. Therefore, all four possible photoinduced rotation steps (clockwise and counterclockwise directions) can be quantified. Comparison of the corresponding quantum yields to the unrestricted motor delivers direct evidence for unidirectionality.

In addition, we note that in model peptides, when Yaa is unmodified proline, the Xaa proline has a strong propensity to adopt an endo ring conformation, whilst when Yaa is hydroxyproline, the Xaa proline adopts a range of endo and exo conformations. Here we use a combination of solid-state NMR spectroscopy and potential energy landscape modelling of synthetic triple-helical collagen peptides to understand this effect.

So far, it has not been possible to design a self-assembled discrete molecule made up of more than 100 components. Such molecules—for example, spherical virus capsids10—are prevalent in nature, which suggests that the difficulty in designing these very large self-assembled molecules is due to a lack of understanding of the underlying design principles. For example, the targeted assembly of a series of large spherical structures containing up to 30 palladium ions coordinated by up to 60 bent organic ligands11,12,13,14,15,16 was achieved by considering their topologies17. Here we report the self-assembly of a spherical structure that also contains 30 palladium ions and 60 bent ligands, but belongs to a shape family that has not previously been observed experimentally17. The new structure consists of a combination of 8 triangles and 24 squares, and has the symmetry of a tetravalent Goldberg polyhedron18,19.

Thus the photomechanical behaviour can be induced by choosing a suitable metal ion. The above findings are thoroughly validated by quantitative density functional theory (DFT) calculations which show that the Zn-based crystal shifts towards an orthorhombic structure to resolve the anisotropic UV-induced mechanical strain.

Such separation is achieved by photoswitching the fluorophores between a long-lived OFF state and an emissive ON state. Although STORM can image single molecules, molecular counting remains challenging due to undercounting errors from photobleached or overlapping dyes and overcounting artefacts from the repetitive random blinking of dyes. Here we show that fluorophores can be electrochemically switched for STORM imaging (EC-STORM), with excellent control over the switching kinetics, duty cycle and recovery yield. Using EC-STORM, we demonstrate molecular counting by using electrochemical potential to control the photophysics of dyes. The random blinking of dyes is suppressed by a negative potential but the switching-ON event can be activated by a short positive-potential pulse, such that the frequency of ON events scales linearly with the number of underlying dyes. We also demonstrate EC-STORM of tubulin in fixed cells with a spatial resolution as low as ~28 nm and counting of single Alexa 647 fluorophores on various DNA nanoruler structures.

A significant obstacle is the requirement to optimize the wavefunction from scratch for each new system, thus requiring long optimization. In this work, we propose a neural network ansatz, which effectively maps uncorrelated, computationally cheap Hartree-Fock orbitals, to correlated, high-accuracy neural network orbitals. This ansatz is inherently capable of learning a single wavefunction across multiple compounds and geometries, as we demonstrate by successfully transferring a wavefunction model pre-trained on smaller fragments to larger compounds. Furthermore, we provide ample experimental evidence to support the idea that extensive pre-training of such a generalized wavefunction model across different compounds and geometries could lead to a foundation wavefunction model. Such a model could yield high-accuracy ab-initio energies using only minimal computational effort for fine-tuning and evaluation of observables.","Atomic and molecular physics, Chemical physics, Computational science, Method development",2024-01-02,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-023-44216-9,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41467-023-44216-9.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Towards a transferable fermionic neural wavefunction for molecules.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Recent applications of FSRS from physics, chemistry and biology are showcased, demonstrating how this approach has facilitated cross-disciplinary studies. We also address the technical and conceptual limitations of FSRS to aid in designing optimal experiments based on specific goals.

Chiral nanostructures have been produced using nanofabrication techniques such as lithography7 and molecular self-assembly8,9,10,11, but large-scale and simple fabrication methods for three-dimensional chiral structures remain a challenge. In this regard, chirality transfer represents a simpler and more efficient method for controlling chiral morphology12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Although a few studies18,19 have described the transfer of molecular chirality into micrometre-sized helical ceramic crystals, this technique has yet to be implemented for metal nanoparticles with sizes of hundreds of nanometres. Here we develop a strategy for synthesizing chiral gold nanoparticles that involves using amino acids and peptides to control the optical activity, handedness and chiral plasmonic resonance of the nanoparticles. The key requirement for achieving such chiral structures is the formation of high-Miller-index surfaces ({hkl}, h ≠ k ≠ l ≠ 0) that are intrinsically chiral, owing to the presence of ‘kink’ sites20,21,22 in the nanoparticles during growth. The presence of chiral components at the inorganic surface of the nanoparticles and in the amino acids and peptides results in enantioselective interactions at the interface between these elements; these interactions lead to asymmetric evolution of the nanoparticles and the formation of helicoid morphologies that consist of highly twisted chiral elements. The gold nanoparticles that we grow display strong chiral plasmonic optical activity (a dis-symmetry factor of 0.2), even when dispersed randomly in solution; this observation is supported by theoretical calculations and direct visualizations of macroscopic colour transformations. We anticipate that our strategy will aid in the rational design and fabrication of three-dimensional chiral nanostructures for use in plasmonic metamaterial applications.","Metamaterials, Nanoparticle synthesis, Nanoparticles",2018-04-18,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41586-018-0034-1,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41586-018-0034-1.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Amino-acid- and peptide-directed synthesis of chiral plasmonic gold nanoparticles.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

In the cholesteric mesophase formation, at concentrations of more than 50 wt% HPC, helical pitch (P) was confirmed to shift upward according to the chaotropic strength of X–, for example, in a manner satisfying the order of Cl−<Br−<NO3−<I−. Organocations generally elevated P relative to the nonionic reference, the effectiveness being pronounced in the order of [C2Mim]+<[C4Mim]+<[C6Mim]+. With regard to LCST behavior, imidazolium additives raised the cloud point (Tc) in the isotropic solutions of ⩽40 wt% HPC, whereas the Tc value of mesomorphic solutions was prone to be lowered by the addition. Discussion of these observations took into consideration the differences in the N-alkyl structure and amphiphilic nature between cationic imidazolium varieties, as well as the difference in the chaotropic strength between the counter anions. It was also exemplified preliminarily that this kind of salt-containing lyotropic system of HPC exercised an electro-optical function when coupled with an electric circuit.","cholesteric pitch, HPC, imidazolium salt, LCST behavior, liquid crystal, Polymer chemistry",2010-01-13,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/pj2009338,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/pj2009338.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Addition effects of imidazolium salts on mesophase structure and optical properties of concentrated hydroxypropyl cellulose aqueous solutions.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Silver iodide (AgI) serves as one of the most universal and efficient ice nucleating agents. Despite the acknowledged influence of factors like low lattice mismatch and surface dipole fields on the rapid freezing of water on AgI surfaces, one commonly neglects the impact of irregular surfaces on nucleation mechanisms. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore heterogeneous ice nucleation on irregular AgI surfaces. Unlike the prevailing view, our study reveals an unconventional nucleation pathway where water molecules align themselves with spatially inhomogeneous dipole field near irregular AgI surfaces. This alignment is triggered by a deviation in orientation between the water molecular dipole and the spatial dipole field generated by AgI substrates, leading to the crystallisation of distinct metastable ice phases. These findings promote our understanding of ice nucleation on AgI surfaces, highlighting the role of surface roughness in the molecular-level phase transitions.","Molecular dynamics, Phase transitions and critical phenomena, Theory and computation",2025-01-02,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s42005-024-01929-7,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s42005-024-01929-7.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Unconventional ice nucleation pathway induced by irregular silver iodide surfaces.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

The constrained geometries of ring systems are particularly predisposed to creating strain. Recently, there has been increased interest in leveraging this property of rings as a synthetic tool by building strain into substrates to activate a desired bond-cleavage step. However, one could also envisage alternative uses of strain. Here we outline how geometry control can be exploited to ‘switch on’ dynamic processes or stabilize reactive transition states. By designing constrained molecular structures that direct strain on particular bonds or functional groups, transformations that are otherwise energetically uphill can become favoured.

Cellulose II can also be produced by the precipitation of the cellulose solutions (regeneration). The currently accepted theory implies that in cellulose II, both mercerized and regenerated, the macromolecules are arranged antiparallelly. However, forming such a structure in the course of the mercerization seems to be significantly hindered, while it seems to be quite possible in the regeneration process.

This interest is mainly due to their esthetic synthetic aspects and mechanical properties, but also due to their potential applications in nanotechnological areas, including magnetic materials, guest selectivity, allosteric binding, or thermoresponsive behavior in elastomeric materials. In this article, a perspective on the research on interlocked MOCs (i.e., [2]-catenanes), covering from the first examples of interlocked MOCs to the latest research in this area is presented. The emphasis is in the synthetic methods used for their preparation and the structure‒function correlation aspects. The combination of experimental techniques in the solution state (i.e., NMR, ESI-MAS, etc.) and solid-state X-ray structural data, in combination with theoretical calculations have been very important to getting a rationalization of the experimental results. The described [2]-catenanes are formed from mechanically bonded hollow cages, therefore they can be exploited in host-guest chemistry applications typical from MOCs, with enhanced physical properties ranging from the mechanical bonds like enhanced cage’s strength and dynamic behavior, which are needed for developing new smart functional materials.","Interlocked molecules, Self-assembly",2025-03-27,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s42004-025-01493-3,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s42004-025-01493-3.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Mechanical interlocking of metal organic cages.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Without template anion, a micrometer-sized sheet is kinetically trapped (off-pathway), which is converted into the thermodynamically most stable cage by the template anion. When the template anion is present from the start, the cage is selectively produced by the preferential cyclization of a dinuclear intermediate (on-pathway).

Zimanyi","Scientific Reports","The efficiency of nanoparticle (NP) solar cells has grown impressively in recent years, exceeding 16%. However, the carrier mobility in NP solar cells, and in other optoelectronic applications remains low, thus critically limiting their performance. Therefore, carrier transport in NP solids needs to be better understood to further improve the overall efficiency of NP solar cell technology. However, it is technically challenging to simulate experimental scale samples, as physical processes from atomic to mesoscopic scales all crucially impact transport. To rise to this challenge, here we report the development of TRIDENS: the Transport in Defected Nanoparticle Solids Simulator, that adds three more hierarchical layers to our previously developed HINTS code for nanoparticle solar cells. In TRIDENS, we first introduced planar defects, such as twin planes and grain boundaries into individual NP SLs superlattices (SLs) that comprised the order of 103 NPs. Then we used HINTS to simulate the transport across tens of thousands of defected NP SLs, and constructed the distribution of the NP SL mobilities with planar defects. Second, the defected NP SLs were assembled into a resistor network with more than 104 NP SLs, thus representing about 107 individual NPs. Finally, the TRIDENS results were analyzed by finite size scaling to explore whether the percolation transition, separating the phase where the low mobility defected NP SLs percolate, from the phase where the high mobility undefected NP SLs percolate drives a low-mobility-to-highmobility transport crossover that can be extrapolated to genuinely macroscopic length scales. For the theoretical description, we adapted the Efros-Shklovskii bimodal mobility distribution percolation model. We demonstrated that the ES bimodal theory’s two-variable scaling function is an effective tool to quantitatively characterize this low-mobility-to-high-mobility transport crossover.","Chemistry, Condensed-matter physics, Materials science, Phase transitions and critical phenomena, Physics",2021-04-02,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-021-86790-2,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-021-86790-2.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Hierarchical carrier transport simulator for defected nanoparticle solids.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Mathies, Marco Garavelli, Giulio Cerullo",Nature,"Ever since the conversion of the 11-cis retinal chromophore to its all-trans form in rhodopsin was identified as the primary photochemical event in vision1, experimentalists and theoreticians have tried to unravel the molecular details of this process. The high quantum yield of 0.65 (ref. 2), the production of the primary ground-state rhodopsin photoproduct within a mere 200 fs (refs 3–7), and the storage of considerable energy in the first stable bathorhodopsin intermediate8 all suggest an unusually fast and efficient photoactivated one-way reaction9. Rhodopsin's unique reactivity is generally attributed to a conical intersection between the potential energy surfaces of the ground and excited electronic states10,11 enabling the efficient and ultrafast conversion of photon energy into chemical energy12,13,14,15,16. But obtaining direct experimental evidence for the involvement of a conical intersection is challenging: the energy gap between the electronic states of the reacting molecule changes significantly over an ultrashort timescale, which calls for observational methods that combine high temporal resolution with a broad spectral observation window. Here we show that ultrafast optical spectroscopy with sub-20-fs time resolution and spectral coverage from the visible to the near-infrared allows us to follow the dynamics leading to the conical intersection in rhodopsin isomerization. We track coherent wave-packet motion from the photoexcited Franck–Condon region to the photoproduct by monitoring the loss of reactant emission and the subsequent appearance of photoproduct absorption, and find excellent agreement between the experimental observations and molecular dynamics calculations that involve a true electronic state crossing. Taken together, these findings constitute the most compelling evidence to date for the existence and importance of conical intersections in visual photochemistry.","Membrane proteins, Molecular biophysics, Photochemistry",2010-09-23,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature09346,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature09346.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Conical intersection dynamics of the primary photoisomerization event in vision.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

In the substituted Cs2AgMCl6, the presence of mixed M3+ sites distorts the [AgCl6]5- octahedra, affecting the parity of the valence and conduction band edges and thereby altering the optical transitions.

Considering perovskite series with three M3+ cations, namely Bi3+, In3+ and Sb3+, the mixed trivalent cationic compounds with specific ratios of In3+ and Bi3+ show white light emission with intensity nearly 150 times larger than that of the parent compounds, and are characterised by excited state lifetimes nearing 1 μs. Using single crystal X-ray diffraction, far-infrared absorption, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, bias-dependent photoluminescence, P-E loop traces and density-functional theory calculations, we hence demonstrate the role of octahedral distortion in enhancing white light emission and excited state lifetimes of halide double perovskites.","Condensed-matter physics, Devices for energy harvesting, Energy, Excited states, Materials for energy and catalysis",2021-06-21,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s43246-021-00172-9,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s43246-021-00172-9.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Manipulation of parity and polarization through structural distortion in light-emitting halide double perovskites.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

We heated the micrometers-long TEMPO-CNFs in saturated water vapor (≥ 120 °C, ≥ 0.2 MPa) and observed a surprising fact that the long TEMPO-CNFs unzipped into short (100 s of nanometers long) fibers.

However, it is not well understood how the polymer components cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin co-operate to resist tensile stress in wood. From X-ray scattering, neutron scattering and spectroscopic data, collected under tension and processed by novel methods, the ordered, disordered and hemicellulose-coated cellulose components comprising each microfibril were shown to stretch together and demonstrated concerted, viscous stress relaxation facilitated by water. Different cellulose microfibrils did not all stretch to the same degree. Attempts were made to distinguish between microfibrils showing large and small elongation but these domains were shown to be similar with respect to orientation, crystalline disorder, hydration and the presence of bound xylan. These observations are consistent with a major stress transfer process between microfibrils being shear at interfaces in direct, hydrogen-bonded contact, as demonstrated by small-angle neutron scattering. If stress were transmitted between microfibrils by bridging hemicelluloses these might have been expected to show divergent stretching and relaxation behaviour, which was not observed.

To date, de novo metalloproteins have used simple, symmetric tertiary structures — uncomplicated by the large size and evolutionary marks of natural proteins — to interrogate structure–function hypotheses. In this Review, we discuss de novo design applications, such as proteins that induce complex, increasingly asymmetric ligand geometries to achieve function, as well as the use of more canonical ligand geometries to achieve stability. De novo design has been used to explore how proteins fine-tune redox potentials and catalyse both oxidative and hydrolytic reactions. With an increased understanding of structure–function relationships, functional proteins including O2-dependent oxidases, fast hydrolases and multi-proton/multielectron reductases have been created.

The paradigm relies on a molecularly designed photoelastomer ink with both thiol and disulfide groups, where the former facilitates a thiol-ene photopolymerization during the additive manufacturing process and the latter enables a disulfide metathesis reaction during the self-healing process. We find that the competition between the thiol and disulfide groups governs the photocuring rate and self-healing efficiency of the photoelastomer. The self-healing behavior of the photoelastomer is understood with a theoretical model that agrees well with the experimental results.

We use molecular dynamics simulations to examine the binding mode and mechanism of the photoacids and its influence on the unique kinetic rates and diffusion properties of the photoacid’s dissociated proton, where we also suggest a proton transfer process between one of the photoacids to proximal histidine residues.

However, when 5′-BODIPY-CN-TBA is base-paired to a complementary strand in the B-form duplex, the emission of the BODIPY-CN end-label increases 7-fold, 14-fold compared to the free-dye. This signal-on response enables the BODIPY-CN end-label to serve as a quencher-free fluorescent probe for monitoring duplex-GQ exchange. The visible end-label minimally perturbs GQ stability and thrombin binding affinity, and the modified TBA can act as a combinatorial logic circuit having INHIBIT logic functions. These attributes make BODIPY-CN a highly useful end-label for creating nanomolecular devices derived from G-rich oligonucleotides.","Thrombin-binding Aptamer (TBA), Fluorescent Base Analogues (FBAs), BODIPY Core, Duplex Samples, Boron Trifluoride Diethyl Ether, Chemical modification, DNA",2018-11-15,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-018-35352-0,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-018-35352-0.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/A 5′-BODIPY End-label for Monitoring DNA Duplex-Quadruplex Exchange.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust3,4. Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors5,6,7,8, the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers9,10,11. An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods12. Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks13,14. Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device.","Conjugated polymers, Electronic devices",2016-11-16,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature20102,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/nature20102.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Intrinsically stretchable and healable semiconducting polymer for organic transistors.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

The availability of reliable synthetic protocols to prepare catalysts that allow the efficient incorporation of fluorine in organic molecules is therefore essential for broad applicability. Herein, we report a protocol for the multigram synthesis of two representative enantiopure N-alkyl bis-urea organocatalysts derived from (S)-(–)-1,1′-binaphthyl-2,2′-diamine ((S)-BINAM). These tridentate hydrogen bond donors are highly effective phase-transfer catalysts for solubilizing safe and inexpensive metal alkali fluorides (KF and CsF) in organic solvents for enantioselective nucleophilic fluorinations. The first catalyst, characterized by N-isopropyl substitution, was obtained by using a two-step sequence consisting of reductive amination followed by urea coupling from commercially available starting materials (14 g, 48% yield and 5-d total synthesis time). The second catalyst, featuring N-ethyl alkylation and meta-terphenyl substituents, was accessed via a novel, scalable, convergent route that concluded with the coupling between N-ethylated (S)-BINAM and a preformed isocyanate (52 g and 52% overall yield). On this scale, the synthesis requires ~10 d. This can be reduced to 5 d by performing some steps in parallel. Compared to the previous synthetic route, this protocol avoids the final chromatographic purification and produces the desired catalysts in very high purity and improved yield.","Catalyst synthesis, Synthetic chemistry methodology",2021-11-10,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41596-021-00625-y,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41596-021-00625-y.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Multigram synthesis of N-alkyl bis-ureas for asymmetric hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Here we study the mechanism of the formation of a flower-shaped supramolecular structure of phosphonic acid appended naphthalene diimide with melamine. The flower-shaped assembly formation was visualised by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, furthermore, XRD and DLS used to determined mode of aggregation. Characteristically, phosphonic acid-substituted at imide position of NDIs possess two important properties resulting in the formation of controlled flower-like nanostructures: (i) the aromatic core of the NDI which is designed to optimize the dispersive interactions (π-π stacking and van der Waals interactions) between the cores within a construct and (ii) phosphonic acid of NDI interact with malamine through molecular recognition i.e. strong hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding). We believe such arrangements prevent crystallization and favour the directional growth of flower-like nanostructure in 3D fashion. These works demonstrate that complex self-assembly can indeed be attained through hierarchical non-covalent interactions of two components. Furthermore, flower-like structures built from molecular recognition by these molecules indicate their potential in other fields if combined with other chemical entities.","Molecular self-assembly, Self-assembly",2015-09-29,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/srep14609,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/srep14609.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Flower-like supramolecular self-assembly of phosphonic acid appended naphthalene diimide and melamine.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

To provide structural basis for the considerable biochemical and biophysical experiments previously performed on Tn501 and Tn21 MerR from Gram-negative bacteria, we analyzed the crystal structure of mercury(II)-bound Tn501 MerR. The structure in the metal-binding domain provides Tn501 MerR with a high affinity for mercury(II) and the ability to distinguish mercury(II) from other metals with its unique planar trigonal coordination geometry, which is adopted by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The mercury(II) coordination state in the C-terminal metal-binding domain is transmitted through the allosteric network across the dimer interface to the N-terminal DNA-binding domain.

Nephrotoxicity is the main dose-limiting toxicity, and several hydration therapies and supplementary strategies are utilized to reduce cisplatin-induced kidney damage, so the discovery and development of effective and safe antitumor drugs are still on the path of human health. Herein, a new four-coordinated Pt complex [Pt(TSC)Cl] using N(4)-phenyl-2-formylpyridine thiosemicarbazone (HTSC) was synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, 1HNMR, FT-IR, LC/MS and CHN elemental analysis. The Pt(TSC)Cl complex revealed antiproliferative activity against A549, MCF-7 and Caco-2 cell lines with a low micromolar IC50 (200–1.75 µM). Specifically, the Pt(TSC)Cl complex displayed more selectivity in Caco-2 cells (IC50 = 2.3 µM) than cisplatin (IC50 = 107 µM) after 48 h of treatment. Moreover, compared with cisplatin, a known nephrotoxic drug, the Pt(TSC)Cl complex exhibited lower nephrotoxicity against Hek293 normal cells. We also found that the Pt(TSC)Cl complex can effectively prevent cancer cell propagation in sub-G1 and S phases and induce apoptosis (more than 90%). Real time PCR and western analysis demonstrated that the expression pattern of apoptotic genes and proteins is according to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through the Bax/Bcl-2-Casp9-Casp3/Casp7 axis. Collectively, our findings indicated that the Pt(TSC)Cl complex triggers apoptosis in Caco-2 cell lines, while low nephrotoxicity was shown and may be considered a useful anticancer drug candidate for colorectal cancers for further optimization and growth.","Biochemistry, Cancer, Chemical biology, Chemistry",2022-05-18,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-022-11904-3,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-022-11904-3.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Enhanced anticancer potency with reduced nephrotoxicity of newly synthesized platin-based complexes compared with cisplatin.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Here, by fluorescence microscopy, we directly show the localisation of LMW molecules at the topological line defects of a nematic LC. It is theoretically explained that excess free energy density of nematic ordering at the defect core allows LMW solutes to accumulate at a non-negligible level overcoming the entropy leading to their uniform distributions.

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the crystalline ordering in the films was greatly influenced by the molecular weight (MW) of P3HT. In contrast, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed that the MW had no significant effects on the α1 relaxation process, which corresponded to the twisting motion of thiophene rings in the crystalline phase unless the MW was quite small. Femtosecond transient absorption (TAS) spectroscopy showed that better crystalline ordering led to the direct formation of polarons (P) from hot excitons at room temperature. Once the temperature went beyond Tα1, at approximately 310 K, the P formation process from polaron pairs (PP) was activated.

In this paper we present a model describing the inactivation process of the well-characterized (S)-selective amine transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum. The cornerstone of the model, supported by structural, computational, mutagenesis and biophysical data, is the central role of the catalytic lysine as a conformational switch. Upon breakage of the lysine-PLP Schiff base, the strain associated with the catalytically active lysine conformation is dissipated in a slow relaxation process capable of triggering the known structural rearrangements occurring in the holo-to-apo transition and ultimately promoting dimer dissociation. Due to the occurrence in the literature of similar PLP-dependent inactivation models valid for other non-transaminase enzymes belonging to the same fold-class, the role of the catalytic lysine as conformational switch might extend beyond the transaminase enzyme group and offer new insight to drive future non-trivial engineering strategies.","Biocatalysis, Enzyme mechanisms, Transferases",2019-11-18,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-019-53177-3,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41598-019-53177-3.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Insight into the dimer dissociation process of the Chromobacterium violaceum (S)-selective amine transaminase.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

The performance of the devices depends on the properties of carriers within the molecules of functional polymers. Therefore, the carrier properties should be strongly influenced by the structures and physical properties of the films. In addition, an interfacial effect becomes more pronounced once the functional polymers are used in a thin-film state and integrated with other inorganic materials. How the chain packing and mobility affect the carrier properties in a thin film should be clarified to design more developed functional devises. In this focus review, the relationship among the aggregation states, the thermal molecular motion, and the carrier properties of the functional polymers and their interfacial effects are discussed.","Polymer characterization, Polymers",2023-07-24,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41428-023-00820-6,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41428-023-00820-6.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Aggregation states, thermal molecular motion and carrier properties in functional polymer thin films.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

As a candidate to satisfy the above requirements, optical anion sensors have recently attracted much attention, and thus many efforts have been made to develop materials for sensor applications. This article reviews recent progress in the design and fabrication of conjugated polymer-based anion sensors. The validity of polymer-based anion sensors has been verified through the evaluation of colorimetric and fluorescent responses for a series of conjugated polymers with different binding sites and varied pendant structures. Through rational molecular design of the sensor polymers, certain structures have been found to possess desirable anion detection abilities, including enhanced binding affinity, strict size specificity and applicability to anions in an aqueous environment. Thus, the demonstration described in this focused review could provide useful insight not only for anion detection chemistry but also for polymer and supramolecular chemistry.","Analytical chemistry, Conjugated polymers, Environmental sciences, Halogen bonding",2015-09-16,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/pj201572,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/pj201572.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Conjugated polymers applicable to colorimetric and fluorescent anion detection.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

The miscibility of saturated hydrocarbon polymers (polyolefins) is shown to be essentially controlled by the values of their solubility parameters as determined by several kinds of measurements, but most importantly from neutron scattering. Moreover, the way that these solubility parameters depend on the chain dimensions of the chains, is outlined. A method to estimate chain dimensions by a correlation of the fraction of carbons that are on side branches vs the backbone is also given. The combination of these relations thus provides a very powerful mechanism to predict the mixing thermodynamics of polyolefins blends based simply on their chemical structure.","chain dimensions, miscibility, neutron scattering, packing length, polyolefin, solubility, Physical chemistry, Polymer characterization, Polymers",2012-11-14,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/pj2012191,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/pj2012191.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/The application of neutron scattering to the relation between chain dimensions and miscibility for polyolefins.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"

Marsh, Martin Heeney","Polymer Journal","The intrinsic flexibility, solution processability, and optoelectronic properties of semiconducting conjugated polymers make them ideal candidates for use in a wide range of next-generation electronic devices. A virtually unlimited chemical design space has led to diverse polymeric architectures made from combinations of smaller molecular building blocks with desirable functionalities. Of these, thiophene is undoubtedly the most common due to its mixture of synthetic versatility, polymer backbone planarizing effects, and good optoelectronic characteristics. However, the success of thiophene has meant that other heterocycles, such as selenophene, remain relatively underexplored. This focus review discusses the challenges and material advantages of incorporating selenophene into conjugated polymer systems within the context of our contributions to the field. The early studies of poorly performing electrochemically synthesized polyselenophenes are outlined, progressing onto the model chemically synthesized alkylated homopolymers that revealed the key consequences of selenophene addition. We then review the various donor and donor-acceptor copolymer strategies that have exploited the properties of the selenium atom to enhance the performance of solar cells, transistors, and other organic electronic devices. Finally, we give our perspective on the state of the field and the fundamental material optimization studies required to realize the full potential of selenophene-containing conjugated polymers.","Conjugated polymers, Soft materials",2022-12-06,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41428-022-00731-y,https://nature.f.33tsg.xyz/articles/s41428-022-00731-y.pdf,"C:\Users\shiji\Desktop\coding\sci_crawler\t_a_download/Conjugated polymers based on selenophene building blocks.pdf",NULL,NULL,"2025-07-11 20:07:41","2025-07-11 20:07:41"
